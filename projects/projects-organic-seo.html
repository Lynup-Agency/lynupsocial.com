		               <p>From keyword discovery to information architecture to content creation to analytics, Lynup can provide the tools you need to make SEO deliver ROI. We can design and build it for you or simply provide guidance, or anything in between.</p>

		               <p>SEO can be explained as the process of giving Google what Google wants. Google wants to match searchers with websites that contain what they are looking for. It's that simple. SEOs call that relevancy. Google rewards sites that offer content tailored to a precise understanding of what the site really offers and what its visitors are really seeking. Effective SEO begins with the content and architecture of your site. Once your site has been optimized, the SEO process shifts to external factors - Inbound Links, Directory Listings, etc. - that can influence your search rankings.</p>
