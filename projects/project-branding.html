		               <p>You’ve got something solid – a great product, a top-notch team, a fantastic mission, but something’s not quite resonating right. Or maybe you’re updating your services and you need a fresh look. Your logo was designed when Paula Abdul was still on American Idol or your website is rocking Comic Sans (we won’t judge). You’re not reaching the right people with your message and you’re not sure why. </p>


		               <p>Is this working? Enter Lynup. We’ll analyze your brand and your audience, figure out what’s working and what’s not, make sure your messaging is on target and give your marketing a makeover. It’s like updating your basic jeans-and-white-shirt with a new belt and stylish (but comfortable!) boots.</p>
