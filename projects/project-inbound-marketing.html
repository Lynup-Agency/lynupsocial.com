		               <p>
		               	You know that home you just bought? Well, after you threw down your 20% the mortgage company came up with the balance. How did you find that mortgage company? Oh, that’s right; you downloaded their handy guide to getting the best deal on a mortgage. After you read their guide you gave them a call. That’s inbound marketing, and it works great when you want to build trust with potential customers. Instead of pitching people on why your business is the best, you provide them with white papers, guides, eBooks and blog posts that prove that you are the best. Lynup develops complete inbound marketing campaigns, content and advertising for higher quality leads.
