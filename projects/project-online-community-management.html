		               <p>You have a few thousand fans, now what do you do with them? Keep them entertained with funny cat videos and hope they buy something eventually? Well, sure, that might work. Or you can have a dedicated community manager whose sole purpose in life is to engage those fans, use them to get new ones, and make sure that as many as possible are paying customers. A little more work than cat videos, maybe. But weâ€™re up for it.</p>
