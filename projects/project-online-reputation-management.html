		               <p>Like it or not, Yelp and other online review sites are here to stay. You can ignore them and hope the Kraken eventually comes and pulls them to the darkest, deepest depths of the ocean…or you can learn to live with them. And we can help.</p>

						<p>Let’s face it, you just don’t have time to keep up with every single review on every single site (and let’s not forget the blogs and other articles that may get published, with or without you knowing it). We have a super-sophisticated team of trained squirrels that will let us know every time you get mentioned online. Then we deploy the trained chipmunks to take appropriate action and keep you smelling like a rose.</p>
